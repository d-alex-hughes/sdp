    "text": "5.2 Failure Points in Ideal Experiments\n\nYour theory isn‚Äôt precise enough. While you‚Äôve been building your explanation for ‚Äúwhy‚Äù the world works, you‚Äôve elided parts of the thinking that are necessary to produce a whole story. Imprecise theory produces bulky tests that don‚Äôt actually have crisp predictions.\nYour theory overlaps too much with existing theories. If you cannot produce a prediction that would be true if and only if your theory were correct, you haven‚Äôt made a contribution to the field!\nThe other theories aren‚Äôt precise enough. It isn‚Äôt a problem of your creation, but it is a problem that you‚Äôve got to address. If the existing theory (‚ÄúProspect Theory‚Äù anyone?) isn‚Äôt sufficiently well developed, then it will overlap with your work.\nYou don‚Äôt know all the theories out there. This is hard, you‚Äôre a burgeoning professional, but you don‚Äôt know everything! (Neither do I; Ralph and Eric may).",
